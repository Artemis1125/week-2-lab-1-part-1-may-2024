    <h2>
    why dogs are considered family!
    </h2>
    <p> 
    dogs are the <strong>most loyal</strong>pets you could <em> ever </em> have! Don't <strong> believe </strong> me? Read the next paragraph, and you'll see why!
    </p>
    <p>
    Dogs are not only loyal but they are also very protective. Dogs can be your best friend and your playmate! Some dogs also make great hunter dogs. If I could adopt all of the dogs in the world I would!
